<h2>Sharks vs Surfers: An Infographic</h2>
<a target="_blank" href="images///sharks.png"> <img src="images///sharks.png" alt="Shark Attacks on Surfers Infographic" title="Shark Attacks on Surfers Infographic" id="img13"></a>
<p class="p1">This infographic was created in May, 2019. Inspiration for this project stems from my passion for surfing paired with my opinion that sharks have a "bad rap". Software used was ESRI's ArcMap and Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator. The project was well recieved and provoked many stimulating discussions during Fleming College's GIS Open House Day in which members of the public were invited to join faculty, peers, and family in assessing students work.

<h2>An Excercise With Adobe</h2>

	id="img13"> </a> 
	<p class="p1">
		This cartographic excercise relied heavily upon digital image manipulation through tools such as Illustrator and Photoshop. Drawing from my passion for Indigenous Canadian folklore and mythology, I created this piece to pay homage to the Labrador Innu's oral history regarding the creation of fog which masks the magnificent landscape on a daily basis. The project's duration was brief and required a submission in less than a weeks time which resulted in this prompt submission.

<h2>A Wild Time in the Wildlands of Ontario</h2>

	<p class="p1"> As a tribute to my six day solo canoe trip through the fabled Wildlands Provincial Park, this cartographic rendering pays homage to my heart and soul. The trip was undertaken during the July, 2017 and pushed my mind, body and soul through some very challenging activities (and portages). The map has been published in collaboration with a side project of mine, Plaid'n'Paddles. The concept of the blog is to bridge the gap between the great outdoors and those who are not afforded the luxury of partaking in similar experiences. Ultimately, it is my goal to create a positive and accessible atmosphere that promotes outdoor education and awareness through blogs, stories, and maps.

<h2>A Dasymetric Density Analysis of Toronto's Population</h2>
<img src="images///toronto.jpg" alt="Toronto's Population Density Through a Dasymeteric analysis" title="Toronto's Population Density Through a Dasymeteric Analysis"
	id="img13">
	<p class="p1">Through this amazing cartographic experience, I expanded upon some extremely interesting skills originally gained through my Fish and Wildlife Diploma. Using a customized model in ArcMap 10.6, I subtracted the uninhabited areas of Toronto to create a glimpse of actual population density. This included creating buffers around roads, and subtracting the roads along with park lands, industrial zoned areas, ashphalt and parking lot areas (as well as the airport grounds) and waterways such as rivers and streams to create a true glimpse of population dispersion. Although not cartographically correct, I used my favourite colour blue to emphasize the population in an attempt to create a subtle yet stark comparison of the density.</p>

	<h2>The Pulse of Peterborough</h2>
	<img src="images///elecity.png" alt="The Electric City" title="The Electric City"
		id="img13">
		<p class="p1">This cartographic rendering was created with the intention of combining an informational map depicting age dispersion in Peterborough while celebrating the City's 150 birthday. It was in Peterborough that electricity in a town was first impemented, encouraging economic and social growth. In this modern day, the pulse of Peterborough is not charged by electricity, but rather by it's citizens. It was my hope to illustrate the dispersion of the working class in the city that truly charges the current growth of both the city's social and economic pulse.</p>
